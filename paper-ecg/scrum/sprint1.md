# Sprint 1
Oct 19 - Nov 9


## Sprint goal

Get everything setup for successful development in the following sprints.


## Product log

This is the log of all tasks and features. 

- Select GUI library
- Create build instructions
- Figure out dependencies for our project
- Learn about OpenCV / image analysis
- Learn about PyQt
- Design the high-level architecture of the application 


## Member tasks

### Natalie

- Learn about OpenCV / image analysis
- Learn about PyQt
- Design the high-level architecture of the application 

### Julian

- Learn about PyQt
- Select GUI library
- Create build instructions
- Figure out dependencies for our project


## Scrum record

Julian researched GUI libraries and built a demo application using PyQt, Qt Designer, and FBS.

Both team members conducted a literature review.

Natalie is concerned about managing Python versions on Windows, so we need to find a solution that works on Windows.


## Sprint Review

Our goal was:

> Get everything setup for successful development in the following sprints.

We nailed our goal, and even got the initial structure of the application set up.

### What We Did

#### Natalie

- ✅ Learned about OpenCV / image analysis.
- ✅ Learned about PyQt.
- ✅ Implemented MVC and structured the code.
- ✅ Created a file opener for image files.
- ✅ Displaying a user-selected image file.

#### Julian

- ✅ Select GUI library.
- ✅ Picked distribution system (fman) and set up.
- ✅ Created build instructions.
- ✅ Learned about PyQt.
- ✅ Made a rough draft of the controls pane.


## Retrospective

> If our project is a boat ⛵️, what is the **wind**, **anchors**, and **icebergs**?

🦄  - Julian

🐝  - Natalie

### 💨 Wind (What went well)

- 🦄  All of our meetings.
- 🐝  Inter-team communication.
- 🦄 &🐝  Ta feedback (❤️).

### ⚓️ Anchors (What didn't go well)

- 🐝  Installing Python and setting up on Windows.
- 🐝  New user of Python and new to application development.
- 🦄  Lack of Qt knowledge.

### 🧊 Icebergs (Potential risks/future problems)

- 🦄  Still has a big question mark on how the image interface (e.i., selecting regions, overlaying signal) will work.
- 🐝  Code spaghetti and scaling pains, especially with creating widgets in Python.
